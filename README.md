This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

Key Highlights of the Project:

Authentication: Implemented secure user login and registration with JWT-based authentication.

Task Management: Users can easily create, update, delete, and manage tasks with a seamless experience.

Custom Backend: Built a custom REST API from scratch to handle task operations, ensuring full control and flexibility.

State Management: Leveraged Redux Toolkit for global state management, making the app highly scalable and maintainable.

Database: Integrated MongoDB for reliable and fast data storage, ensuring smooth performance and real-time updates.

This project was an exciting challenge and a great opportunity to deepen my skills in React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and Redux Toolkit while delivering a robust solution for task management
